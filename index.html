        <h3>Welcome!</h3>
        <p>The Catrobat umbrella project is as a mentoring organization for <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2012/catroidproject">Google Summer of Code 2012</a>!</p>

        <p><strong>Catroid</strong> is an on-device visual programming system for Android devices that is inspired by the <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> programming language developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.</p>

        <p><strong>Catrobat</strong> is the name of the visual programming language. Catrobat programs can be written by using the Catroid programming system on Android phones and tablets.</p>

        <p><strong>Paintroid</strong> is an associated graphical paint editor program for the Android platform that, among others, allows setting parts of pictures to transparent.</p>

        <p>The <a href="http://www.catroid.org">Catroid community website</a> features Catrobat projects (also called Catrobat programs) uploaded directly from Catroid. These projects can be downloaded and opened in Catroid, for execution on one's Android device and also for remixing. Further functionality such as commenting, forums, a wiki and many others are planned.</p>

        <p><strong>Please note</strong> that Catroid, Paintroid, as well as the Catroid community website are currently in beta development stage. You are welcome to download and use them, including to upload your own projects to the community website.</p>
